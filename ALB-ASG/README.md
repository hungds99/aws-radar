# Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) and Auto Scaling Group (ASG)

## Scalability and High Availability

- **Scalability**: The ability of a system to handle increased load by adding resources.

  Example: An application that can handle 100 users per second and can be scaled to handle 1000 users per second.

  - **Vertical Scalability**: Increasing the capacity of a single machine. (ex: adding more RAM, CPU, etc.)
  - **Horizontal Scalability**: Increasing the number of machines. (ex: adding more servers)

- **High Availability**: The ability of a system to remain operational even if some of its components fail.
  - Example: A system that can handle 100 users per second and remains operational even if one of its servers fails.
