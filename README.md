### What is Cloud ?

X has just built a web application and wants to deploy this application on the internet. X sets up a server, installs the operating system, installs the necessary software, configures the network, secures it, and many other tasks. But after a while, X realizes that this is very complicated and expensive. X decides to look for another solution.

X heard about Cloud, and decided to use cloud services to deploy his application.

Cloud is a form of service delivery over the internet. These services can include servers, storage, databases, networks, software...

Advantages:

- Flexible and easy to scale
- Cost savings
- Provides APIs to interact with cloud services
- From that day on, X doesn't have to worry about configuring servers, managing networks, security, etc. X just needs to focus on - developing his application, and use cloud services to deploy the application.

Currently, cloud services are often provided by cloud service providers, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform...

So if you want to learn about Cloud, you can start with AWS. Create an AWS account and start learning!
